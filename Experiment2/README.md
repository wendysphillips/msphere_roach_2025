# README

This code processes 16S amplicon sequencing reads, creates taxa tables from QC'd reads, and generates a phyloseq object. It contains a single code file: **A_create_phyloseq.R**. However, prior to running that R script, the code in **Experiment1/code/cutadapt.txt** needs to be run.  

The file **ps_exp2.Rds** is the generated phyloseq object.
