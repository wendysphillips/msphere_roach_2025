## Virus-induced perturbations in the mouse microbiome are impacted by microbial experience

This study includes data from two separate experiments - Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. 

- Experiment 1 includes samples from three tissue types: small intestine, cecum, and large intestine.
- Experiment 2 includes only small intestine samples.

There are separate directories containing separate analyses for each of those experiments. The **Experiment 1** directory contains the code for a full analysis is provided. The **Experiment 2** directory contains only code related to preparing a phyloseq object.

The small intestine samples from both experiments were combined and analyzed together. The relevant code for that analysis is in the directory **Combined1_2**.
